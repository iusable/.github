## Hi there 👋

# 🙋‍♀️ What's iusable?
iusable is a project by [Colin Carter](https://colincart.me). It is a collection of all side-projects and legal applications he's developped in his free time. 
iusable has focused on AI projects since 2020. 

# ❤️ Open-Source?
This organization will host some closed- and some open-source projects. 
Before creating this organization Colin has released repositories on his personal GitHub Account such as:

- [legal instruct](https://github.com/colin-r-carter/legal-instruct): Scripts and datasets for legal instructions.

🌈 Pull Requests are welcome on all public repos both here and on my personal profile. Open to collaborations as well!
